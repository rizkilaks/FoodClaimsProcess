## Data Discovery and Visualization

### How does the number of claims differ across locations?

There are four locations and Sao Luis has the highest number of claims in all locations, namely 28. While the rest are not much different from each other, namely 22, 21, and 20 for Recife, Fortaleza and Natal, respectively. From these claims, there are so many unknown causes, followed by meat, and vegetables, which are only assigned to the legal team in Sao Luis and Recife.
